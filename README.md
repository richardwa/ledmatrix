# ledmatrix
C (avr-gcc) library to control 2 pin bi colored ledmatrix

bi colored leds with 2 pins are pretty cool.  Much fewer connections, and you still get 2 colors.  They work by having one color in one direction and different color when the current is flipped.  I did not find any libraries out there that would work a matrix of these bad boys, so here it is.

Personally, I made this to include into my planck/tmk firmware keyboard to have individually controllable backlight.
